'''
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            temp = False
            for j in range(0, i):
                temp  = temp or (dp[j] and s[j:i] in wordDict)
            dp[i] = temp
        return dp[len(s)]
